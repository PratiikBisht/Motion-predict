Description: This project involves developing a real-time object tracking system using a webcam. The system will detect and track objects (like red and blue points) in the video feed using color-based detection and Kalman filters for prediction and smoothing.

Key Features:


1)Real-time video capture and processing.  

2)Color-based object detection (RedPointDetector and BluePointDetector).

3)Kalman filter implementation for tracking and predicting object positions.

4)Saving the processed video to a file.

Technologies:


1)Python
2)OpenCV
3)NumPy
