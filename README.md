Description: This project involves developing a real-time object tracking system using a webcam. The system will detect and track objects (like red and blue points) in the video feed using color-based detection and Kalman filters for prediction and smoothing.

Key Features:

Real-time video capture and processing.
Color-based object detection (RedPointDetector and BluePointDetector).
Kalman filter implementation for tracking and predicting object positions.
Saving the processed video to a file.
Technologies:

Python
OpenCV
NumPy
