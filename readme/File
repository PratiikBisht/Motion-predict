# Real-Time Object Tracking with Kalman Filter

This project implements real-time object tracking using a webcam. It detects and tracks red and blue points in the video feed using color-based detection and Kalman filters.

## Features
- Real-time video capture and processing.
- Color-based object detection (RedPointDetector and BluePointDetector).
- Kalman filter implementation for tracking and predicting object positions.
- Saving the processed video to a file.
